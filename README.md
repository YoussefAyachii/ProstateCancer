# ProstateCancer
This project aims to identify the genes that are differentially expressed in prostate cancer. Our dataset consists in the expression level of 6033 genes measured in 50 healthy patients and 52 prostate cancer patients. In this context, we will apply multiple hypothesis testing and some of related corrections as the Bonferroni, Holm and Benjamini-Hochberg corretions.
