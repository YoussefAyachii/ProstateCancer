# ProstateCancer
This project aims to identify genes that are differentially expressed in prostate cancer. Our dataset consists in the expression level of 6033 genes measured in 50 healthy patients and 52 prostate cancer patients. In this context, we will perform multiple hypothesis testing and use related corrections such as Bonferroni, Holm and Benjamini-Hochberg corrections.
